abstract="Robot applications are increasingly based on teams of robots that collaborate to perform a desired mission. Such applications ask for decentralized techniques that allow for tractable automated planning. Another aspect that current robot applications must consider is partial knowledge about the environment in which the robots are operating and the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the robots' actions.",
