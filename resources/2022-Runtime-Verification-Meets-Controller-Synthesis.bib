abstract="Reactive synthesis guarantees correct-by-construction controllers from logical specifications, but is costly---2EXPTIME-complete in the size of the specification. In a practical setting, the desired controllers need to interact with an environment, but the more precise the model of the environment used for synthesis, the greater the cost of synthesis. This can be avoided by using suitable abstractions of the environment, but this in turn requires appropriate techniques to mediate between controllers and the real environment. Runtime verification can help here, with monitors acting as these mediators, and even as activators or orchestrators of the desired controllers. In this paper we survey literature for combinations of monitors with controller synthesis, and consider other potential combinations as future research directions.",
